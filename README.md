# responsive-recipe-website

Thank you for taking a look at my code.

This is the second iteration of my first project for The Odin Project. 

A responsive recipe website (Landing page) using purely HTML and CSS with one media query.

I know that there's still things to improve and I'm more than excited to learn more so that I could design and code a better version.
